# AlgoRank

A full-stack DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) problem-solving platform inspired by LeetCode and Striver's TUF+ platform. Built as a production-style learning project to understand modern full-stack development: from frontend UI frameworks to backend APIs, database design, authentication, and deployment.

**Live Demo:** [AlgoRank](https://algo-rank.vercel.app) | **Backend API:** [Render](https://algorank-v14y.onrender.com) | **Database:** Neon | **Code Execution:** Self-hosted Piston (Oracle Cloud, Always Free)

---

## 🎯 Project Intent

This project was built with a singular goal: **understand how real-world production applications are architected and deployed.**

Rather than following tutorials blindly, I chose to build an end-to-end application that required:
- Modern frontend framework with state management
- Secure backend with authentication and authorization
- Complex database relationships and migrations
- Integration with external services (Judege0 code execution APIs)
- Production deployment with environment management
- Debugging and problem-solving across the entire stack

The result is a functional platform where users can solve DSA problems, track progress, and organize problems into custom playlists—all while learning critical engineering patterns.

## 🆕 What's New (Recent Updates)

- **Self-hosted code execution:** Replaced the public Piston API with our own Piston instance on Oracle Cloud (Always Free) — no API keys, no quotas, we control the runtimes.
- **Reliable grading with a solution harness:** Added a wrapper that detects function-style and `class Solution`-style submissions (JS & Python), runs every test case through it, and compares outputs properly.
- **Per-test metrics:** Submissions now record memory (KB) and time (s) for each test case and show them in the results.
- **Submission history fixed:** The backend now returns the submission under a consistent key and orders by newest first — history actually loads.
- **Leaderboard & rankings:** Global leaderboard plus per-user rank/stats cards.
- **Create a problem flow that works:** Reference-solution validation is now best-effort (missing runtimes don't block creation) and the "Load Sample" buttons load the correct problem type.
- **Auto-cleanup of demo problems:** Problems created during a session are deleted on logout, so the 500+ seeded problems stay clean.
- **Seed data:** Now 500+ curated + auto-generated problems (was 30+).

## 🎓 Key Challenges & Learnings

### **1. Code Execution Integration**
**Challenge:** Integrating Judge0 for reliable code execution proved complex.

**Issues Encountered:**
- Incorrect language ID mappings (Python vs Python3, etc.)
- Async polling for submission results with timeouts
- Rate limiting and API quota management
- Error responses that didn't clearly indicate failures

**Solutions:**
- Built language mapping layer between frontend and APIs
- Implemented exponential backoff for polling
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- Switched to Piston API as backup with fallback logic

**Learning:** External service integrations require defensive programming—always have fallbacks and clear error messages, spned almost 5 days into this ... but will try again.

---

### **2. Authentication in Production**
**Challenge:** JWT authentication worked seamlessly on localhost but failed in production.

**Root Causes:**
- CORS headers not properly configured for Vercel domain
- Cookies not being sent with credentials flag
- Environment variables not synced correctly on Railway

**Solutions:**
- Implemented proper CORS middleware with origin whitelisting
- Configured `credentials: 'include'` in Axios
- Set up environment variable validation on startup
- Added detailed logging to track auth failures

**Learning:** Development ≠ production. Always test cross-origin requests and credential handling before deploying.

---

### **3. Deployment Complexity**
**Challenge:** First production deployment revealed hidden complexities (spent nearly a full day debugging).

**Issues:**
- Database migrations failing silently on Railway
- Environment variables leaking or being undefined
- Frontend calling wrong API endpoints in production build
- Vercel caching build artifacts inconsistently

**Solutions:**
- Automated Prisma migrations in Railway's post-deployment script
- Created `.env.example` and strict validation
- Implemented feature flags for API endpoint selection
- Learned Vercel's deployment caching and cache invalidation

**Learning:** Deployment isn't just "push to prod." It requires infrastructure knowledge, proper environment management, and extensive testing.

---

### **4. State Management at Scale**
**Challenge:** Managing global state across multiple features (auth, problems, submissions, playlists) became complex with useState.

**Solution:** Adopted Zustand for lightweight, scalable state management.

**Benefits:**
- Separate stores for each domain (problems, submissions, playlists)
- Minimal boilerplate compared to Redux
- Built-in persistence with localStorage
- Clean separation of concerns

**Learning:** Choose state management based on project scale, not hype. Zustand proved perfect for this size.

---

### **5. Database Design & Relations**
**Challenge:** Modeling complex relationships between Users, Problems, Submissions, Playlists, and TestCases.

**Key Decisions:**
- Many-to-many relationship for Problems-in-Playlist
- One-to-many for User-to-Submissions
- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- Cascade deletes for data integrity

**Learning:** Good database design prevents N+1 queries and ensures scalability from day one, loved this specific phase .

## 🤔 Why This Project Matters

This isn't a side project or weekend hack—it's a comprehensive learning exercise that taught me:

1. **System Design Thinking:** How to architect a system that scales from day one
2. **Debugging Skills:** Production bugs are different; they require logs, traces, and patience
3. **DevOps Basics:** learned Dockers on the way  Environment management, deployment pipelines, and infrastructure
4. **Security:** Authentication, authorization, and input validation matter more than code quality
5. **Real-World Constraints:** Users expect 99.9% uptime; your code will fail in production
6. **Communication:** Clear error messages and logging make debugging 10x faster

The code isn't perfect, but it's *honest*—it reflects real challenges and real solutions, not textbook examples.
